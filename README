Type "make" to build the starlanes binaries, then sign on as root
an type "make fakeinstall"
which will, uh, pretend to install everything.  If all the commands that
it's going to execute look correct, go ahead and type "make install" (as
root) to install the goods.

I would like to claim that the reason there is no
configure file is because for a small program
a configure file would be overkill but the
truth is that I don't as yet know how to make
one.  Hence the make file may need adjusting.
For instance sometimes the curses program is
called plain curses and sometimes ncurses
It also expects there to be a /man/man6/ directory
in which case you should 

Please, if you have any problems while installing 
let me, David, know ("dejvid@zamir.net" and 
"dejvid@barnsdle.demon.co.uk") even if you
solve them.     

Of course you can always just change to the directory where
you installed starlanes and type "./starlanes"

This is a port to C from a version of Starlanes for the Osborne 1.  The
original source is from a First Osborne Group (FOG) disk that I probably
picked up in 1982.  The author isn't identified.  Based on comments in
a TRS-80 version I picked up off the web, it would appear that it was
first published in Creative Computing magazine.
